# Candy Festival

Is the candy themed submission to OGAM JAM (one game a month).

## Idea

The factory is full of fresh candies and we have to store them as fast as we can to ship it to every person in the world.

## Inside it

Made with createjs and gimp (yep I made the art also) 

## How to play

Drag the candies to the board till you fill it. Fill the field as fast as you can to earn more points.

## Where to Play

You can play it [here](candy-festival.vnavarro.com.br)

## Future desired features 

* Faster candy drop rate
* Candy rotation
* Recycle bin - So we can 'erase' candies from the board or the treadmil

(Unfortunately doesn't mean I will have time to do it)

## Bugs? Comments?
